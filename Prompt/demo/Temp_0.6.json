Pertinent Results:ADMISSION LABS:DISCHARGE LABS:IMAGING STUDIES:FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin demonstrates a cysticstructure with swirling flow consistent with pseudoaneurysm. The neckmeasures approximately 5 mm. The pseudoaneurysm measures 2.1 x 1.2 cm. IMPRESSION: Findings in the right groin are consistent with pseudoaneurysm.--------------Femoral Vascular US R ___:FINDINGS: The right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is completely thrombosedand demonstrates no flow on color Doppler ultrasound. The right commonfemoral artery and vein are patent. The superficial femoral artery and veinsare also unremarkable. IMPRESSION:1. Thrombosed right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.2. Patent right common and superficial femoral arteries and veins. Brief Hospital Course:This is a ___ year old female with uterine fibroid embolization on ___ who presented with right groin pain and swelling determined by ultrasound to be a pseudoaneurysm.1) Pseudoaneurysm: Patient presented with psuedoaneurysm confirmed by ultrasound that was secondary to her recent uterine fibroid embolization on ___. On ___ patient underwent psuedoaneurysm thrombin injection. Ultrasound on ___ indicated pseudoaneurysm had been thrombosed with remaining femoral artery patent. A repeat US on ___ prior to discharge also demonstrated thrombosed right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm and patent right common and superficial femoral arteries and veins. Following thrombin injection patient experienced right groin pain. She also experienced pain in her pelvic region thought to be secondary to fibroids responding to embolization procedure. Pain initially treated with intravenous morphine and transitioned to oral oxycodone at time of discharge. She was given a prescription for oxycodone 5mg ___ tabs TID as needed for pain. She was instructed not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking this medication. She was also prescribed ibuprofen 800 mg PO TID to reduce inflammation and instructed to take this medication with food and water.

Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO three times a day as needed for pain.Disp:*18 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* Discharge Disposition:Home Discharge Diagnosis:Primary: Right groin pseudoaneurysmSecondary: Rheumatoid arthritis Discharge Condition:good Discharge Instructions:You came to the emergency department because you were having severe right sided groin pain. In the ED it was determined that you had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by your recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional radiology performed a thrombin injection into your pseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable pain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. This pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. We treated your pain with IV pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned you to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your pain.You had constipation during your admission though you do have baseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you on a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and biscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during your hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you have constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain control, have not physically been moving since your procedure and have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with senna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement in the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which you noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary care physician.You were started on the following new medications:**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication reduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take this medication with food and water since it can cause stomach irritation.**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for pain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause constipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not drive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipationFollow up as per below.If you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, increased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness of breath please call your primary care provider or go to the emergency department for evaluation.",

There is mild septal deviation to the left. The aortia is of normal caliber. There is no lymphadenopathy. The major airways are patent. There are grounglass opacities in the left upper lobe. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, scarring. Impression:Positive for pulmonary emboli with large clot burden.Grounglass opacities in the left upper lobe, nonspecific, may be infectious/inflammatory or atypical pulmonary infarct.Echo ___:Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with abnormal septal motion suggestive of right ventricular pressure/volume overload (e.g. primary pulmonary process such as PE or COPD). Mildly dilated aortic root. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.Lower extremity Doppler US:Left deep venous thrombus within the proximal femoral vein extending to the popliteal vein, nonocclusive. Posterior tibial occlusive thrombus identified. Right popliteal deep venous non occlusive thrombus.  Brief Hospital Course:The patient is ___ year old male who presented with one day history of SOB found to have bilateral PE's at outside hospital, troponin of 0.32, sinus tachycardia on ECG, and right ventricular strain on Echo requiring transfer to CCU for thrombolysis.#Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms: Patient noted to have bilateral pulmonary embolism noted at outside hospital to have bilateral pulmonary embolism. The patient was transferred to the CCU for thrombolysis. The patient was started on tPA protocol as follows: tPA 10mg IV over 1 minute then 40mg over 2 hours with continued Unfractionated heparin at 1000u/hour with transition to weight based heparin until therapeutic. Following this, the patient was started on xarelto 15 mg BID on ___ for 3 weeks and then continued on 20 mg xarelto daily. Ambulating on 5L O2, he gets moderately SOB but mainatins O2 sat > 88%. He has been instructed to use O2 with any exertion. The etiology of the patient's pulmonary embolism and lower extremity DVT's was unclear but thought to be due to possible factor V leiden deficiency and other work up given family history in mother of recurrent DVT's as well as recurrent DVT's in father. Plan for outpatient follow up with Hem/Onc to address hypercoagulable work up with Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid syndrome. Patient also with plan to follow up with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. #HypoxiaPatient's hypoxia and oxygen requirement thought to be secondary to bilateral pulmonary embolisms as above. The patient was discharged with home oxygen requirement for sleep and ambulation.#Type II Diabetes with peripheral neuropathyPatient continued on ISS and daily lantus and humalog. Metformin held.Gabapentin 100 mg TID continued#HLDPatient continued on simvastatin 40 mg daily.#Chronic Low Back PainPatient with chronic low back pain. He was continued on tramadol 50 mg daily.
