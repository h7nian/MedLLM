On ___ patient underwent  psuedoaneurysm thrombin injection. Ultrasound on ___ indicated  pseudoaneurysm had been thrombosed with remaining femoral artery  patent. A repeat US on ___ prior to discharge also demonstrated  thrombosed right femoral artery  pseudoaneurysm and patent right common and superficial femoral  arteries and veins. Following thrombin injection patient  experienced right groin pain. She also experienced pain in her  pelvic region thought to be secondary to fibroids responding to  embolization procedure. Pain initially treated with intravenous  morphine and transitioned to oral oxycodone at time of  discharge. She was given a prescription for oxycodone 5mg ___  tabs TID as needed for pain. She was instructed not to drive or  operate heavy machinery while taking this medication.

Initial  labs were unremarkable.   CXR here showed no evidence of PNA.   UA was grossly positive and the patient was given IV  ceftriaxone, Lovenox 70 mg x 1 prior to transfer.  Of note, the patient was most recently discharged from ___ in  ___ for seizure activity and was found to have a 3 cm  atypical meningioma. Per ___ discussion with the patient's  niece, surgical intervention was deferred.  Her course at the  time was also notable for new paroxysmal AFib; given her  CHADSVASC score of 4, anticoagulation was warranted.  However,  given her age, risk of fall, and her new intracranial lesion  (high risk for venous bleed), anticoagulation was deferred.   From further collateral information obtained from her SNF (Vero  Health and Rehab of Mattapan) this evening, it is unclear why  the patient was not started on anticoagulation for DVT treatment  and why the patient was transferred to ___ for further evaluation.  The ED attempted to reach out to the family re utility of IVC filter placement in this setting, but was unable  to contact the family.  Upon arrival to the floor, the patient denies any chest pain or  SOB.  She has had a cough x 2 weeks; she has had no fevers.  She  is AOx2 to self and place (at baseline).

Ms. ___ declined surgery, but ultimately agreed with a radical mastectomy for palliative reasons.    She was interested in being able to attend church and be able to spend more time with her family and friends, which she has been able to do.  Prior to the procedure, she spent her time homebound requiring dressing changes every two to two and a half hours and persistently had a very foul-smelling odor.  At the time of the right modified radical mastectomy on ___, she was found to have an invasive ductal carcinoma, 19 x 16 x 11.5 cm with direct invasion into the dermis and epidermis of  the skin with ulceration, grade 3 and deep margins negative, less than 0.1 cm from the deep margin for invasive carcinoma.  She  had nine negative axillary lymph nodes.  The tumor was estrogen and progesterone and HER-2/neu negative.  She did well until early ___ when she was noted to have recurrent nodules on her chest wall. She was seen by her medical oncologist, Dr. ___.

The  patient was transferred to the CCU for thrombolysis. The patient was started on tPA protocol as follows tPA 10mg IV over 1  minute then 40mg over 2 hours with continued Unfractionated  heparin at 1000u/hour with transition to weight based heparin  until therapeutic.
