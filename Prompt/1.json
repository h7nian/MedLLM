The left atrium is normal in size. \nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \nnumber of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic \nvalve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic \nvalve stenosis (valve area = 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be \nunderestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is \nseen (may be underestimated). There is borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial \neffusion.  \n\n___ CT CHEST \n \nAlthough there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, severe \ncoronary \ncalcification and sufficient aortic valvular calcification to \nproduce aortic stenosis, the extremely asymmetric and non \ndependent distribution of the severe interstitial and alveolar \nabnormality, favoring the right lung and \nscattered elsewhere in the periphery of the left lung means that \ncardiogenic pulmonary edema is not a sufficient explanation for \nthe severe lung findings although it may be contributory. \n  \nDifferential diagnosis of the pulmonary abnormality includes \nsevere viral \ninfection, viral infection leading to diffuse alveolar damage, \nand acute \ninterstitial pneumonia.  The large region of sparing in the left \nlower lobe argues against pneumocystis pneumonia, but certainly \ndoes not exclude that \ndiagnosis. \nSevere generalized atherosclerotic calcification involves the \nhead and neck vessels, particular the carotid arteries in \naddition to the coronaries. \n\n___ CT CHEST:  \n1.  Slight interval improvement in persistent extensive \npulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, worst in the right upper \nlobe.  Differential diagnosis includes, as before, severe viral \ninfection and acute interstitial pneumonia.  \nChronic aspiration is possible as well. \n2.  Posterior defect in the trachea is not currently seen and \nlikely \nrepresented artifact on prior CT.  Confirmation of \ntracheoesophageal fistula would require barium swallow study \nunder fluoroscopy. \n  \nMICRO:\n\n___ 6:26 pm Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture\n      Site: NASOPHARYNX      Source: Nasopharyngeal swab. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Respiratory Viral Culture (Final ___: \n      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED. \n      Refer to respiratory viral antigen screen and respiratory \nvirus\n      identification test results for further information. \n\n   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final ___: \n      Positive for Respiratory viral antigens. \n      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, \nInfluenza A, B,\n      and RSV by immunofluorescence. \n      Refer to Respiratory Virus Identification for further \ninformation. \n\n   Respiratory Virus Identification (Final ___: \n      Reported to and read back by ___ (4I) ___ AT \n1139. \n      POSITIVE FOR PARAINFLUENZA TYPE 3. \n         Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence. \n\n                      **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final ___: \n      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN. \n           (Reference Range-Negative). \n      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay. \n      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other \nL.\n      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. \nFurthermore, in\n      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may \nvary. \n\n___ 4:27 am SPUTUM\n\n   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: \n      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field. \n      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. \n\n   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary): \n\n___ 12:23 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   MRSA SCREEN (Final ___:    No MRSA isolated. \n\n___ URINE CULTURE - NEG\n___ BLOOD CULTURE - NEG\n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD WBC-12.3* RBC-2.28* Hgb-7.3* Hct-22.0* \nMCV-97 MCH-32.0 MCHC-33.2 RDW-20.3* RDWSD-70.2* Plt ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD ___ PTT-35.2 ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD Glucose-101* UreaN-16 Creat-1.0 Na-126* \nK-4.1 Cl-86* HCO3-30 AnGap-14\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD ALT-29 AST-31 LD(LDH)-577* AlkPhos-127 \nTotBili-0.___ y/o male with a PMH of rheumatoid arthritis currently \nreceiving rituximab (q6 months), plaquenil, and prednisone \n(history of multiple previous DMARDs), recent diagnosis of \nEnterococcal bacteremia and osteomyelitis at an OSH, MDS, afib, \nand CHF currently admitted to ___ with dyspnea and hypoxia \nfound to have substantial bilateral interstitial and alveolar \ndisease on CT imaging. The patient has remained profoundly \nhypoxemic despite broad abx coverage and diuresis, and he was \nfound to have an elevated B-glucan and LDH, as well as NP swab \npositive for parainfluenza.\n\n#Goals of care:  ___ wife was called on ___ by Dr. ___ \n___ to discuss worsening respiratory status despite maximum \nintervention within the current goals of care with worsening \nmetabolic state and agitation. Discussed that he has had ongoing \ntreatment for pneumonia (PCP and viral pneumonia) and diuresis \nwithout improvement in his oxygenation and noted to have \nworsening O2 needs. Relayed that our hope has been to get him \nthrough his acute illness but that he is currently showing signs \nof deterioration in terms of his pulmonary function, mental \nstatus and electrolytes concerning for worsening disease \nprocess. Dr. ___ discussed with ___ family that we could \ncontinue to move forward with current care but the concern is \nthat he is worsening and at risk of death. Also noted that he is \nmore uncomfortable with rising oxygen needs. ___ wife \nspoke to her son and called back to confirm they would like to \ntransition to comfort focused care. On ___, Dr. ___ met with \nthe ___ wife and two sons at the ___ bedside to \nconfirm their understanding of the severity of his illness and \nhis wished for ongoing care. Patient unable to participate in \ndiscussion due to delirium. ___ wife and sons noted that \nthey understood that he was worsening and \"dying\" and that they \nwanted to transition to comfort for the patient, per his prior \nwishes. We discussed the steps for this transition including \nmedications to make his breathing more comfortable, help with \nagitation and delirium. The family was offered hospice services \nto help with coping but declined. All questions were answered. \nAfter this, his oxygen was removed and IV morphine drip was \ninitiated for comfort.  \n\n# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure \n# Viral/HCAP/Multilobar/Interstitial Pneumonia \nPresented with persistent hypoxemia. CXR and CT scan suggested \nmultifocal pneumonia most consistent with an atypical viral or \nbacterial etiology.

Because he was DNR/DNI, bronch was not able to pursued \nb/c would have compromised his already tenuous respiratory \nstatus. Initially started on vanc/zosyn for HCAP, steroids and \nBactrim for possible PCP ___ (given recent steroid use), \nand resp viral panel came back positive for H flu. He did not \nimprove on this regimen and still had substantial oxygen \nrequirement. Duiresis was attempted without improvement in \noxygenation. During his course developed worsening acidosis, \nhyponatremia, and altered mental status. He was unable to \ntolerate POs due to altered mental status, and it was confirmed \nwith family that NGT/PEG were not in goals of care. In this \nsetting he was transitioned to comfort care. \n\nOn ___, MD called to bedside by RN at 00:10 for declining \nO2 saturations and bradycardia. Patient appeared comfortable \ntaking shallow, intermittent respirations on morphine drip. \nRespiratory rate decreased and then ceased.
