       "\"Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Established in 1636 and named after its first benefactor, clergyman John Harvard, Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and among the most prestigious in the world. The Massachusetts colonial legislature, the General Court, authorized Harvard's founding. In its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational and Unitarian clergy, although it has never been formally affiliated with any denomination. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869â€“1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II; he liberalized admissions after the war. The university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Arts and Sciences, which oversees Harvard College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Division of Continuing Education, as well as the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard Business School, Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Harvard has three main campuses: the 209-acre Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's endowment is valued at $41.9 billion, making it the largest of any academic institution. Endowment income helps enable the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide generous financial aid with no loans The Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.\""
