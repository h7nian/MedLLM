She was initially \nadmitted to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.\n\n# Hypernatremia: She appeared to have hypovolemic hypernatremia \nbased on clinical exam findings of dry mucous membranes, \nsignificant respiratory variation in IVC diameter, and IJ \ncollapse with respiratory variation.  This is likely \nmultifactorial in the setting of worsening mental status related \nto infection in combination with dementia. Pt was calculated to \nhave a free water deficit of ~5L. Her hypernatremia was \ngradually corrected over the course of 2.5 days with ___ NS \nafter volume resuscitation with LR.  Her sodium was monitored \ndaily and remained within the normal range. Would continue to \nmonitor weekly while at rehab and encourage liquid intake.\n\n# HCAP: On presentation, pt had worsening mental status, \nleukocytosis, and CXR c/w possible left lower lobe PNA.  She had \na new O2 requirement as well.  She was started on vanc, zosyn, \nand azythromycin. She completed an 8 day course on ___.  \nPICC was removed prior to discharge.  Over the course of her \nstay in the ICU, her O2 requirement resolved. At discharge she \nwas afebrile, oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air \nbreathing comfortably, some improving rhonchi at bases. \n\n# Nutrition/Goals of Care: It was suspected that her subacute \nweight loss is due to her dementia.

We \ndiscussed that there is no evidence that tube feeding will \nimprove quality or longevity of life, which he recognized saying \nthat he had dealt with similar issues with his father's chronic \nprogressive illness and ultimately passing. \nDIET: \nRegular; Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed \n(dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids Supplement: Glucerna \nshake breakfast, lunch, dinner pills crushed in puree. \nAspiration precautions, please provide assistance with feeding. \n\n# HTN: Pt was mildly hypotensive on arrival and required volume \nresuscitation; metoprolol was therefore held.

Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia \nprior to eating. \n.  \n# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine elevated on \nadmission to 1.8, downtrending after IVF overnight to 1.5. \nBaseline creatinine is 1.2. Likely prerenal due to poor PO \nintake over the past few days and his positive response to fluid \nchallenge.
