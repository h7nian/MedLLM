In the ED it was determined that \nyou had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by \nyour recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional \nradiology performed a thrombin injection into your \npseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable \npain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. \nThis pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. \nWe treated your pain with IV pain medication and \nanti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned \nyou to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your \npain.\n\nYou had constipation during your admission though you do have \nbaseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you \non a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and \nbiscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during \nyour hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you \nhave constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain \ncontrol, have not physically been moving since your procedure \nand have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with \nsenna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement \nin the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which \nyou noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary \ncare physician.\n\nYou were started on the following new medications:\n**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication \nreduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take \nthis medication with food and water since it can cause stomach \nirritation.\n**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for \npain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause \nconstipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not \ndrive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.\n**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation\n**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation\n**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipation\n\nFollow up as per below.\n\nIf you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, \nincreased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness \nof breath please call your primary care provider or go to the \nemergency department for evaluation.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

There is mild aortic \nvalve stenosis (valve area = 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be \nunderestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is \nseen (may be underestimated). There is borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial \neffusion.  \n\n___ CT CHEST \n \nAlthough there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, severe \ncoronary \ncalcification and sufficient aortic valvular calcification to \nproduce aortic stenosis, the extremely asymmetric and non \ndependent distribution of the severe interstitial and alveolar \nabnormality, favoring the right lung and \nscattered elsewhere in the periphery of the left lung means that \ncardiogenic pulmonary edema is not a sufficient explanation for \nthe severe lung findings although it may be contributory. \n  \nDifferential diagnosis of the pulmonary abnormality includes \nsevere viral \ninfection, viral infection leading to diffuse alveolar damage, \nand acute \ninterstitial pneumonia.  The large region of sparing in the left \nlower lobe argues against pneumocystis pneumonia, but certainly \ndoes not exclude that \ndiagnosis. \nSevere generalized atherosclerotic calcification involves the \nhead and neck vessels, particular the carotid arteries in \naddition to the coronaries. \n\n___ CT CHEST:  \n1.  Slight interval improvement in persistent extensive \npulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, worst in the right upper \nlobe.  Differential diagnosis includes, as before, severe viral \ninfection and acute interstitial pneumonia.  \nChronic aspiration is possible as well. \n2.  Posterior defect in the trachea is not currently seen and \nlikely \nrepresented artifact on prior CT.  Confirmation of \ntracheoesophageal fistula would require barium swallow study \nunder fluoroscopy. \n  \nMICRO:\n\n___ 6:26 pm Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture\n      Site: NASOPHARYNX      Source: Nasopharyngeal swab. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Respiratory Viral Culture (Final ___: \n      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED. \n      Refer to respiratory viral antigen screen and respiratory \nvirus\n      identification test results for further information. \n\n   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final ___: \n      Positive for Respiratory viral antigens. \n      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, \nInfluenza A, B,\n      and RSV by immunofluorescence. \n      Refer to Respiratory Virus Identification for further \ninformation. \n\n   Respiratory Virus Identification (Final ___: \n      Reported to and read back by ___ (4I) ___ AT \n1139. \n      POSITIVE FOR PARAINFLUENZA TYPE 3. \n         Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence. \n\n                      **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final ___: \n      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN. \n           (Reference Range-Negative). \n      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay. \n      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other \nL.\n      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. \nFurthermore, in\n      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may \nvary. \n\n___ 4:27 am SPUTUM\n\n   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: \n      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field. \n      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. \n\n   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary): \n\n___ 12:23 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   MRSA SCREEN (Final ___:    No MRSA isolated. \n\n___ URINE CULTURE - NEG\n___ BLOOD CULTURE - NEG\n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD WBC-12.3* RBC-2.28* Hgb-7.3* Hct-22.0* \nMCV-97 MCH-32.0 MCHC-33.2 RDW-20.3* RDWSD-70.2* Plt ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD ___ PTT-35.2 ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD Glucose-101* UreaN-16 Creat-1.0 Na-126* \nK-4.1 Cl-86* HCO3-30 AnGap-14\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD ALT-29 AST-31 LD(LDH)-577* AlkPhos-127 \nTotBili-0.___ y/o male with a PMH of rheumatoid arthritis currently \nreceiving rituximab (q6 months), plaquenil, and prednisone \n(history of multiple previous DMARDs), recent diagnosis of \nEnterococcal bacteremia and osteomyelitis at an OSH, MDS, afib, \nand CHF currently admitted to ___ with dyspnea and hypoxia \nfound to have substantial bilateral interstitial and alveolar \ndisease on CT imaging.

ACS was unlikely \ngiven 3 days of symptoms and troponin is <0.1.  Urine and blood \ncultures were negative.  Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia \nprior to eating. \n.  \n# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine elevated on \nadmission to 1.8, downtrending after IVF overnight to 1.5. \nBaseline creatinine is 1.2. Likely prerenal due to poor PO \nintake over the past few days and his positive response to fluid \nchallenge.  His atenolol was held accordingly.\n.  \n# Rash on Palms: Unclear from notes how long this has been \npresent. Patient had a negative RPR in ___, and unlikely to \nhave developed syphilis since then. RPR negative.  \n.  \n# Anemia: Hematocrit at baseline this morning.  Iron studies, \nB12 and folate were within normal limits.\n.  \n# CAD: Patient has known 3VD that is not able to be intervened \non. Patient denies chest pain and cardiac enzymes negative x2.  \nHe was continued on plavix, aspirin, statin, isosorbide and his \nACE.  His atenolol was held given ___.\n.  \n# Hypertension: He was hypertensive during admission as his \natenolol was held in the setting of ___.  He was restarted on \nisosorbide and his ACE on the second day of admission.

There is mild septal deviation \nto the left. The aortia is of normal caliber. There is no \nlymphadenopathy. The major airways are patent. There are \ngrounglass opacities in the left upper lobe. There is no pleural \neffusion or pneumothorax. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental \natelectasis, scarring. \n\nImpression:\nPositive for pulmonary emboli with large clot burden.\nGrounglass opacities in the left upper lobe, nonspecific, may be \ninfectious/inflammatory or atypical pulmonary infarct.\n\nEcho ___:\nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular \ncavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There \nis abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right \nventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly \ndilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within \nnormal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an \nanterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\n\nIMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with abnormal \nseptal motion suggestive of right ventricular pressure/volume \noverload (e.g. primary pulmonary process such as PE or COPD). \nMildly dilated aortic root. Severe pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension.\n\nLower extremity Doppler US:\nLeft deep venous thrombus within the proximal femoral vein \nextending to \nthe popliteal vein, nonocclusive. Posterior tibial occlusive \nthrombus \nidentified. Right popliteal deep venous non occlusive thrombus. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is ___ year old male who presented with one day \nhistory of SOB found to have bilateral PE's at outside hospital, \ntroponin of 0.32, sinus tachycardia on ECG, and right \nventricular strain on Echo requiring transfer to CCU for \nthrombolysis.\n\n#Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms: \nPatient noted to have bilateral pulmonary embolism noted at \noutside hospital to have bilateral pulmonary embolism. The \npatient was transferred to the CCU for thrombolysis. The patient \nwas started on tPA protocol as follows: tPA 10mg IV over 1 \nminute then 40mg over 2 hours with continued Unfractionated \nheparin at 1000u/hour with transition to weight based heparin \nuntil therapeutic. Following this, the patient was started on \nxarelto 15 mg BID on ___ for 3 weeks and then continued on \n20 mg xarelto daily. Ambulating on 5L O2, he gets moderately SOB \nbut mainatins O2 sat > 88%. He has been instructed to use O2 \nwith any exertion. The etiology of the patient's pulmonary \nembolism and lower extremity DVT's was unclear but thought to be \ndue to possible factor V leiden deficiency and other work up \ngiven family history in mother of recurrent DVT's as well as \nrecurrent DVT's in father. Plan for outpatient follow up with \nHem/Onc to address hypercoagulable work up with Factor V Leiden \nand antiphospholipid syndrome.
