The patient initially presented in ___ after several weeks of progressive fatigue and was found to be anemic when  attempting to donate blood to ___. Bone marrow biopsy showed AML and he had his first allogeneic SCT on ___. Over the last few years he had been doing well until recently where he was noted  to have persistent cytopenias despite discontinuing certain bone marrow suppressive medications. Repeat bone marrow biopsy on ___ showed relapsed AML. He subsequently underwent induction with MEC+Lenalidomide which was well tolerated other than a 24 pound weight loss. Bone marrow biopsy on ___ showed morphologic remission.   Today, ___ states that he is feeling very well. He had his central line placed by ___ and says that it is not causing too much discomfort. Importantly, he has gained some of his weight back, though his appetite is not what it used to be. Review of systems is otherwise completely negative.

The morphologic and immunophenotypic features are in keeping with involvement by relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. The erythroid dysplasia is of unclear significance.

DISCHARGE LABS ============== ********** Brief Hospital Course:  SUMMARY ___ with relapsed AML, 24 months after allo transplant  s/p reinduction therapy with MEC + Lenalidomide, here for  planned admission for second allo transplant with a different,  matched unrelated donor. Bone marrow engrafted well and patient  cell counts had fully restored by post-transplant day 14.  Hospital course was predominantly complicated by intermittent altered mental status and neutropenic fever, as described below  ACUTE ISSUES # Relapsed AML s/p MUD allo-SCT (___) # Macrocytic anemia, stable Patient underwent reinduction with MEC + Lenalidomide (protocol  ___ phase 2 study) for treatment of adult patients with  relapsed or refractory AML and was admitted for planned allo SCT  from an unrelated donor. She received RIC conditioning with  Flu/Mel beginning ___ and Methotrexate administration on post  transplant Days 1, 6, and ___. Patient was maintained on  posaconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone prophylaxis with plans  to initiate Bactrim prophylaxis on ___. Patient tacrolimus  levels were checked weekly and adjusted throughout his  hospitalization course (most recent level of 10.6 on ___,  regimen changed from 0.5 mg BID to 0.5/0.25 alternating  regimen). EBV viral loads measured bi-weekly (negative to date)  and CMV viral load were measured weekly and negative throughout  patient hospital course. Patient spiked intermittent low grade  fevers throughout the first two weeks of his post transplant  course without localizing symptoms and negative infectious work  up. He was managed on Vancomycin and Cefepime from ___ to ___  and remained afebrile after both medications were discontinued.  Patient pain was initially managed with oxycodone and Ativan,  however, was transitioned to Tylenol/tramadol regimen in setting  of alterations of mental status (described below)  #AMS: Patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of  altered mental status approximately 1 week after transplant. He  initially described episodes as \"hallucinations\" in which he  imagined conversations and encounters that did not occur, as  well as experiencing intermittent auditory hallucinations in  which he would hear music that was not playing. Episodes were  initially associated with headaches and patient underwent brain  MRI that was negative for PRES syndrome, however, showed  symmetric linear dural enhancement. Neuro-oncology and neurology  felt that imaging finding was likely was secondary to medication  toxicity (cefepime) and did not explain his clinical  presentation. He subsequently underwent diagnostic LP that  showed elevated protein (>90) as well as 28 TNC with lymphocytic  predominance. Flow cytometry was not consistent with CNS  involvement in AML and work-up for viral etiology was negative  (with several tests pending). Ultimately, transient nature of  waning mental status was felt to be inconsistent with infectious  etiology and symptoms were ultimately felt to be largely  secondary to multiple mind-altering medications  (oxycodone/Ativan/ambien). Patient mental status largely  improved with discontinuation of this regimen and PRN Haldol and  ramelteon regimen. Patient went several days with appropriate  mental status and without hallucinations prior to discharge.  # Weight loss # Decreased appetite 24 pound weight loss in the setting of re-induction; however  slowly regained weight post transplant. Admission weight is  89.4kg (197 lbs). Daily weights were measured and nutrition  consulted. Home vitamin D supplement continued along with a  multivitamin starting day 1. Weight on discharge is 176.8 lb CHRONIC ISSUES --------------- # Adjustment disorder # Anxiety Home citalopram was continued throughout hospital course.  Patient was initially prescribed Ativan for anxiety, however,  medication was discontinued I/s/o AMS. Patient was prescribed  ramelteon for sleep, however, ultimately was to help with sleep,  however, ultimately was able to sleep through the night without  medication. Social work followed with the patient throughout the  hospitalization.  # Sinus bradycardia:  HR 58 on admission, presumably physiologic secondary to his  young age and the fact that he is physically fit.   # Mild mitral regurgitation # Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation # Mild pulmonary artery hypertension Noted on echocardiogram, no cardiac or respiratory symptoms.  Euvolemic on exam. Was closely monitored for symptoms or signs  of volume overload, especially in the setting of transfusions,  however was not an active issue during his hospital course.
