There is  normal  compressibility, flow and augmentation without evidence of DVT.  Color flow  was demonstrated to the calf veins, without evidence of  thrombus. IMPRESSION No evidence of DVT of the right lower extremity. Brief Hospital Course: ___ admitted with painless bright red blood per rectum.   #GI Bleed. During hospitalization there was no evidence of  active bleeding, the patient remained hemodynamically stable,  and her HCT, which was serially trended, remained stable.   During hospitalization she was transfused 2 units of pRBC and  her HCT responded appropriately increasing from 23.9 on  admission to 32.5 at discharge. The suspicion was highest for  lower GI bleed. GI was consulted and performed a flexible  sigmoidoscopy which demonstrated diffuse non-bleeding  diverticula and grade III non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids.   These were thought to be the sources of her BI bleed.  As an  outpatient, it may be beneficial to get evaluated for  hemorrroidal banding.  Right ___ swelling. The patient endorsed worsening right ___  swelling with correlation of swelling and tenderness on exam,  which was concerning for DVT. However, ___ ultrasound was  negative for DVT. The swelling was believed to be due to  post-surgical changes following a knee operation earlier this  year.   Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient\\'s mobic and ASA were held in  the setting of her GI Bleed. Pain control with tylenol was  adequate. Methotrexate was continued.  These can be restarted  after discussion with her primary care doctor.   Mild Dementia. The patient was well oriented, appropriate  behavior, had capacity for medical decision making, with normal  neurological exam. Donepezil was continued.   Anemia w/ elevated MCV. Baseline HCT variable, appears to be  approximately low ___. However, B12, tsh, folate were normal  consistent with previous work-up.  This should be continued to  be monitored as an outpatient.  Hypertension. The patient remained normotensive. Losartan was  held in setting of GIB, but was restarted prior to discharge.

You underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy to  evaluate for a source of the bleeding.  This showed diverticular  disease and internal hemorrhoids. You tolerated the procedure  well.

Please continue taking your home medications, with one addition. 1. START APPLYING Anusol as directed for your hemorrhoids 2.
