Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old lady with history of 
rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone, leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and question of recent 
stroke with residual R sided weakness, who presents with toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy in setting of pyelonephritis, with MRI 
confirming subacute left corona radiata CVA. 

# Pyelonephritis
# Abdominal pain
Patient presented with fever to 102.7F and diffuse abdominal 
pain, with pyuria on U/A as well as CTA/P remarkable for 
stranding surrounding bladder and near L adrenal/kidney, which 
was repeated later in hospital course for ongoing abdominal pain 
and distension, unrevealing for a new source of pain. Other 
sources of fever considered included possible PNA, given ground 
glass changes in RUL seen on CT chest, however patient without 
cough or hypoxia. She completed 7 day course of antibiotics with 
vancomycin + ceftriaxone ending ___, given history of MRSA UTI 
(at that time with indwelling foley cathether), with resolution 
of fever. Urine cultures returned as mixed bacterial flora, and 
blood cultures notable for only 1 bottle in one set positive for 
coag negative staph after >48 hours, thought to be a 
contaminant. Given clinical stability patient did not receive 
stress dose steroids.

# Toxic metabolic encephalopathy 
# Delirium
In ED patient was very agitated, refusing care, requiring 
multiple doses of IM zyprexa, then on medical floor was 
initially somnolent, with negative CTH. By hospital day 2 was AO 
x 3 after treatment of infection as above. Throughout hospital 
course mental status waxed and waned, likely with component of 
delirium, but improved back to her baseline by discharge 
(oriented and able to perform ___ backwards) as her antibiotics 
course was ending. ___ oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin were 
held in setting of altered mental status, restarted methadone 
partway through hospital course, held others, to be restarted at 
rehab if needed. 

# Right hemiparesis
# Subacute L corona radiata stroke
On HD1, patient noted to have R sided hemiparesis. This was 
previously documented in PCP note from ___, and upon further 
investigation, appeared that patient had presented to ___ 
___ in ___ with complaint of right sided weakness. 
Per their discharge summary, ""patient was not a candidate for 
intravenous alteplase, MRI/MRA of brain was ordered but patient 
was not cooperative. We spoke again with her and family members 
and patient is insisting in refusing brain MRI."" She was 
discharged with aspirin 324 mg and Lipitor 80 mg daily. Their 
exam documents ""AOx2 strength ___ in LUE, ___ ___ in L 
leg and ___ in R leg. Sensation in L arm dull when compared to 
right"". There was also report of patient saying ""this is not the 
first time she is having this right sided weakness and usually 
recovers"". After prolonged discussion, MRI ___ was obtained 
showing late acute to subacute infarct in the left corona 
radiata, no intracranial hemorrhage. Note was also made of 
extensive white matter signal abnormality likely related to 
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. CTA head and neck 
revealed no severe vascular stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm. TTE 
with no definite structural cardiac source of embolism 
identified. Patient was initially maintained on telemetry 
without any report of atrial fibrillation but ultimately 
declined to continue monitoring. Long-term event monitoring 
could be discussed as an outpatient. Regarding other stroke risk 
factors, LDL was 42, TSH 43/fT4 0.7, A1c 6.1. She was placed on 
aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg. ___ and OT evaluated patient 
and recommended rehab, and she was agreeable.

# +BCx for coag negative staph: Aerobic bottle from ___ 
positive for coag negative staph ___ bottles) after >48 hours 
of growth, likely contaminant. However, patient did receive 
vancomycin x 7 days given history of MRSA UTI.

# Hypothyroidism: Note patient with TSH 43, fT4 0.7, was 
evaluated by endocrine at ___ and also seen for this at ___, 
attributed to medication noncompliance, started 125 mcg daily 
weight based in ___ which was continued this stay. She will 
need repeat TSH within 6 weeks. 

# Hypertension: Continued ___ amlodipine. Initially held ___ 
triamterene-HCTZ and losartan I/s/o normotension, held on 
discharge for mild ___.

# ___: Noted to have elevated Creatinine 1.2 from 0.9 and BUN 26 
from 12 one day prior to discharge I/s/o receiving multiple 
contrast loads. Held ___ antihypertensives as above.

# Chronic back and ___ pain: Continued ___ methadone 10 mg 
TID:PRN (confirmed with ___ that patient takes methadone 10 
mg TID:PRN + oxycodone 5 mg TID). ___ oxycodone and gabapentin 
held as above. Please note that per last pain clinic note 
___, there may be an element of opioid induced hyperalgesia 
as well as opioid tolerance. There was recommendation for 
continued gradual taper 10% reduction starting with breakthrough 
oxycodone over ___ intervals then methadone. Her narcotics 
contract from ___ was reviewed (Dr. ___, with 
documentation of plan for taper by 10% every 4 weeks- does not 
appear that this had been done. ___ benefit from new pain clinic 
referral.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  
=====================  
___ year old lady with complex medical history including chronic 
pain/rheumatoid arthritis on prednisone, leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis, uterine cancer s/p hysterectomy, recent CVA in 
___, recently admitted for abdominal pain concerning for 
pyelonephritis, who represented with worsening of her 
periumbilical abdominal pain and back pain. She was found to 
have an abnormal lucency on L4/L5 on CT scan with c/f chronic 
osteomyelitis/discitis vs severe degenerative joint disease. She 
underwent ___ spine biopsy of the lesion, with cultures negative 
to date. 
 
ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:  
======================
# Back pain
# L4/L5 lesion 
Due to complaints of back pain and abdominal pain (as below), 
patient underwent CT A/P  that noted a lucency on L4/L5 c/f 
chronic discitis/osteomyelitis vs severe DJD. This was in the 
setting of one positive blood culture with strep viridans. MRI 
was recommended for further evaluation; however, patient 
refused. Repeat blood cultures were all negative; it is possible 
strep viridans could have represented contaminant. However, 
repeat CRP obtained this admission elevated at 90 (WNL at 
presentation, and also normalized later this admission without 
intervention).  ID was consulted and recommended intervertebral 
disc biopsy and cultures. We deferred MRI based on ID and 
radiology recommendations that a negative MRI would not 
definitively rule out osteomyelitis (would also show 
inflammation even if it were DJD). We proceeded with ___ spine 
biopsy on ___ with both the patient and the patient's HCP 
agreeing with the procedure; the patient did not require 
chemical sedation prior to the procedure. Gram stain 
demonstrated 3+ polymorphonuclear cells. Cultures are negative, 
though acid fast culture and fungal culture are still 
preliminary results.  Patient was discharged afebrile and 
clinically stable to a rehabilitation facility with plan to 
follow up on final culture results. ID (attending Dr. ___ 
___ was aware of discharge plan and in agreement; ID has 
low suspicion for infection at this point and recommend no 
antibiotics. Plan is for ongoing monitoring of her symptoms and 
clinical status at rehab/as an outpatient; if there is any 
recurrent concern for infection (fevers, worsening symptoms, 
persistently elevated CRP, etc), she should be referred to see 
Dr. ___ (ID fellow) as an outpatient. 

# Hypothyroidism: 
Patient exhibited symptoms of depression and withdrawal in the 
setting of hypothyroidism (___: 98). Of note, the patient is 
known to have hypothyroidism non-compliant on levothyroxine. 
Last hospital admission (___), TSH: 43, fT4: 0.7. On this 
hospital admission, TSH was initially found to be 98. She was 
continued on 150 mcg daily. IV levothyroxine was considered; 
however, patient was unwilling to undergo pIV placement and HCP 
was not established at that time. ___ on ___ was 33 and 
patient was continued on PO regimen at 137 mcg daily, with 
endocrinology input. She will need to follow up with 
endocrinology ___ weeks after discharge for repeat TFTs at that 
time. 

# Abdominal pain
Patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain that increased with 
food intake and decreased when applying heat. Patient underwent 
CT A/P in ED due to abdominal pain. Imaging noted possible 
lucency on L4/L5 c/f discitis/osteomyelitis (see back pain/GPC 
bacteremia above). The patient refused MRI and IV medications. 
Bowel regimen was initiated with patient demonstrating relief 
from abdominal pain after bowel movements. Abdominal pain was 
possibly related to constipation. She did not have abdominal 
pain by discharge. 

# Health care proxy (HCP)
# Patient refusal of care 
The patient declined  IV therapy during the majority of her 
hospitalization. She also refused most blood tests.  The patient 
has one biological child: ___, and two step children: 
___ and ___. In ___, ___ was the health care proxy 
but was changed one month later to son ___ was 
contacted but stated she did not wish to serve the role of HCP.  
Following meeting with ___, we filed for HCP affirmation. 
___ was established as HCP on ___ and was kept informed of 
all medical decision making throughout the patient's 
hospitalization. 

# Weight loss
Endorses unintentional weight loss. Per OMR sheets, her standard 
bed weight was 193 lbs on ___ and down to 171 lbs on ___. 
Nutrition was consulted but it was felt that tube feeds would be 
unfeasible given patient's failure to comply with medical 
interventions and refusal to discuss nutritional intervention. 
We encouraged PO intake throughout the hospitalization, provided 
a multivitamin with minerals and initiated mirtazapine to 
stimulate the patient's appetite. She will need to follow up 
with her PCP outpatient regarding this weight loss. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
=======================
# Prediabetes: HbA1c 6.1% on last admission.
Patient's home metformin was held while inpatient and restarted 
for discharge. 
 
# Hyperlipidemia: 
# History of CVA:
Patient was continued home atorvastatin  and aspirin.

# Rheumatoid arthritis: 
Patient was continued on home prednisone 5 mg daily, home 
tylenol, home methadone.

1) Pseudoaneurysm: Patient presented with psuedoaneurysm 
confirmed by ultrasound that was secondary to her recent uterine 
fibroid embolization on ___. On ___ patient underwent 
psuedoaneurysm thrombin injection. Ultrasound on ___ indicated 
pseudoaneurysm had been thrombosed with remaining femoral artery 
patent. A repeat US on ___ prior to discharge also demonstrated 
thrombosed right femoral artery 
pseudoaneurysm and patent right common and superficial femoral 
arteries and veins. Following thrombin injection patient 
experienced right groin pain. She also experienced pain in her

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Right groin pseudoaneurysm
Secondary: Rheumatoid arthritis

 
Discharge Condition:
good

 
Discharge Instructions:
You came to the emergency department because you were having 
severe right sided groin pain. In the ED it was determined that 
you had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by 
your recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional 
radiology performed a thrombin injection into your 
pseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable 
pain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. 
This pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. 
We treated your pain with IV pain medication and 
anti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned 
you to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your 
pain.

You had constipation during your admission though you do have 
baseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you 
on a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and 
biscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during 
your hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you 
have constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain 
control, have not physically been moving since your procedure 
and have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with 
senna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement 
in the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which 
you noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary 
care physician.

You were started on the following new medications:
**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication 
reduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take 
this medication with food and water since it can cause stomach 
irritation.
**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for 
pain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause 
constipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not 
drive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.
**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation
**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation
**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipation

Follow up as per below.

If you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, 
increased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness 
of breath please call your primary care provider or go to the 
emergency department for evaluation.

IMAGING STUDIES: 

ECHO ___
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area = 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be 
underestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen (may be underestimated). There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion.  

___ CT CHEST 
 
Although there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, severe 
coronary 
calcification and sufficient aortic valvular calcification to 
produce aortic stenosis, the extremely asymmetric and non 
dependent distribution of the severe interstitial and alveolar 
abnormality, favoring the right lung and 
scattered elsewhere in the periphery of the left lung means that 
cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not a sufficient explanation for 
the severe lung findings although it may be contributory. 
  
Differential diagnosis of the pulmonary abnormality includes 
severe viral 
infection, viral infection leading to diffuse alveolar damage, 
and acute 
interstitial pneumonia.  The large region of sparing in the left 
lower lobe argues against pneumocystis pneumonia, but certainly 
does not exclude that 
diagnosis. 
Severe generalized atherosclerotic calcification involves the 
head and neck vessels, particular the carotid arteries in 
addition to the coronaries. 

___ CT CHEST:  
1.  Slight interval improvement in persistent extensive 
pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, worst in the right upper 
lobe.  Differential diagnosis includes, as before, severe viral 
infection and acute interstitial pneumonia.  
Chronic aspiration is possible as well. 
2.  Posterior defect in the trachea is not currently seen and 
likely 
represented artifact on prior CT.  Confirmation of 
tracheoesophageal fistula would require barium swallow study 
under fluoroscopy.

(history of multiple previous DMARDs), recent diagnosis of 
Enterococcal bacteremia and osteomyelitis at an OSH, MDS, afib, 
and CHF currently admitted to ___ with dyspnea and hypoxia 
found to have substantial bilateral interstitial and alveolar 
disease on CT imaging. The patient has remained profoundly 
hypoxemic despite broad abx coverage and diuresis, and he was 
found to have an elevated B-glucan and LDH, as well as NP swab 
positive for parainfluenza.

#Goals of care:  ___ wife was called on ___ by Dr. ___ 
___ to discuss worsening respiratory status despite maximum 
intervention within the current goals of care with worsening 
metabolic state and agitation. Discussed that he has had ongoing 
treatment for pneumonia (PCP and viral pneumonia) and diuresis 
without improvement in his oxygenation and noted to have 
worsening O2 needs. Relayed that our hope has been to get him 
through his acute illness but that he is currently showing signs 
of deterioration in terms of his pulmonary function, mental 
status and electrolytes concerning for worsening disease 
process. Dr. ___ discussed with ___ family that we could 
continue to move forward with current care but the concern is 
that he is worsening and at risk of death. Also noted that he is 
more uncomfortable with rising oxygen needs. ___ wife 
spoke to her son and called back to confirm they would like to 
transition to comfort focused care. On ___, Dr. ___ met with 
the ___ wife and two sons at the ___ bedside to 
confirm their understanding of the severity of his illness and 
his wished for ongoing care. Patient unable to participate in 
discussion due to delirium. ___ wife and sons noted that 
they understood that he was worsening and ""dying"" and that they 
wanted to transition to comfort for the patient, per his prior 
wishes. We discussed the steps for this transition including 
medications to make his breathing more comfortable, help with 
agitation and delirium. The family was offered hospice services 
to help with coping but declined. All questions were answered. 
After this, his oxygen was removed and IV morphine drip was 
initiated for comfort.  

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure 
# Viral/HCAP/Multilobar/Interstitial Pneumonia 
Presented with persistent hypoxemia. CXR and CT scan suggested 
multifocal pneumonia most consistent with an atypical viral or 
bacterial etiology. CT showing diffuse asymmetric parenchymal 
changes c/w viral vs. interstitial pneumonia vs. alveolar 
hemorrhage with underlying volume overload possibly contributing 
as well. Because he was DNR/DNI, bronch was not able to pursued 
b/c would have compromised his already tenuous respiratory 
status. Initially started on vanc/zosyn for HCAP, steroids and 
Bactrim for possible PCP ___ (given recent steroid use), 
and resp viral panel came back positive for H flu. He did not 
improve on this regimen and still had substantial oxygen 
requirement. Duiresis was attempted without improvement in 
oxygenation. During his course developed worsening acidosis, 
hyponatremia, and altered mental status. He was unable to 
tolerate POs due to altered mental status, and it was confirmed 
with family that NGT/PEG were not in goals of care. In this 
setting he was transitioned to comfort care. 

On ___, MD called to bedside by RN at 00:10 for declining 
O2 saturations and bradycardia. Patient appeared comfortable 
taking shallow, intermittent respirations on morphine drip. 
Respiratory rate decreased and then ceased. Intermittent ectopy 
noted on telemetry then ceased and pulses were lost. Auscultated 
for breath sounds and cardiac sounds x1 minute with no activity. 
Pupillary response absent. No withdrawal to painful stimuli. 

Time of death 00:15. Cause of death: parainfluenza pneumonia. 
Family (son, ___ notified at 00:20 and expressed gratitude to 
ICU team. Autopsy was declined. Support offered to ___ 
family. Admitting office, overnight ICU attending (Dr. ___, NEOB (declined) and PCP (Dr. ___-

___ U/S FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler sonogram of the 
right common femoral, 
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained. There is 
normal 
compressibility, flow and augmentation without evidence of DVT. 
Color flow 
was demonstrated to the calf veins, without evidence of 
thrombus. 
  
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of the right lower extremity. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ admitted with painless bright red blood per rectum. 

#GI Bleed. During hospitalization there was no evidence of 
active bleeding, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, 
and her HCT, which was serially trended, remained stable.  
During hospitalization she was transfused 2 units of pRBC and 
her HCT responded appropriately increasing from 23.9 on 
admission to 32.5 at discharge. The suspicion was highest for 
lower GI bleed. GI was consulted and performed a flexible 
sigmoidoscopy which demonstrated diffuse non-bleeding 
diverticula and grade III non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids.  
These were thought to be the sources of her BI bleed.  As an 
outpatient, it may be beneficial to get evaluated for 
hemorrroidal banding.

Right ___ swelling. The patient endorsed worsening right ___ 
swelling with correlation of swelling and tenderness on exam, 
which was concerning for DVT. However, ___ ultrasound was 
negative for DVT. The swelling was believed to be due to 
post-surgical changes following a knee operation earlier this 
year. 

Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient's mobic and ASA were held in 
the setting of her GI Bleed. Pain control with tylenol was 
adequate. Methotrexate was continued.  These can be restarted 
after discussion with her primary care doctor.
 
Mild Dementia. The patient was well oriented, appropriate 
behavior, had capacity for medical decision making, with normal 
neurological exam. Donepezil was continued. 

Anemia w/ elevated MCV. Baseline HCT variable, appears to be 
approximately low ___. However, B12, tsh, folate were normal 
consistent with previous work-up.  This should be continued to 
be monitored as an outpatient.

Hypertension. The patient remained normotensive. Losartan was 
held in setting of GIB, but was restarted prior to discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx CHF, Afib not on 
anticoagulation, severe advanced Alzheimer's dementia, 
osteoporosis, HTN, who presents from assisted living facility 
with R hip pain, found to have DVT left common femoral vein with 
volume overload. During a meeting with patient and her family, 
decision was made to transition care to comfort-directed 
measures only and to pursue hospice services on discharge. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============
# CMO. The team had a family meeting on ___ and decision was 
made to transition care to CMO and pursue 24 hour hospice 
services on discharge. Family did not want to pursue active 
treatments such as Lasix, which would make her uncomfortable 
given incontinence or shots such as lovenox for treatment of 
DVT. Home medications metoprolol, donepezil and Memantine were 
continued for comfort. She was discharged to an ___ 
___ facility. 

OTHER HOSPITAL ISSUES 
=====================

# DVT. Deep vein thrombosis of the left common femoral vein 
extending into at least the popliteal vein diagnosed on 
ultrasound on admission. This was likely acquired in the setting 
of immobility, as the patient had been restricted to her 
wheelchair at her assisted living for greater than 1 month due 
to deconditioning. She was initially started on Lovenox for 
treatment but this was discontinued in the setting of transition 
to care to CMO as above. 

# Acute CHF. Patient was volume overloaded on presentation with 
pleural effusions. She was diuresed with IV Lasix. Home 
metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose. In the setting of 
transition to care to CMO, Lasix was discontinued. She was 
continued on metoprolol for comfort. She remained on room air 
without respiratory distress.  

# Afib. She presented in sinus rhythm, rate controlled on 
metoprolol. Metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose for 
comfort. 

# Hip pain. The right hip pain that she presented with was 
resolved by the time of admission. Pelvic xray was without 
fracture. She was treated with Tylenol scheduled for pain 
control. 

# Al___ Dementia. She was AOx1 at her baseline per family 
members. She was continued on Aricept/Namenda.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================

- ___ facility to continue writing orders for 
pain/anxiety/secretions and other symptoms. 
- Continued metoprolol succinate and Memantine and donepezil on 
discharge for comfort. Continuation of these medications can be 
further decided at inpatient hospice. 
- MOLST form: DNR/DNI, do not re-hospitalize

MRI ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Significant interval increase size of an extra-axial frontal 
lobe 
parafalcine lesion, compatible with a meningioma.  Given the 
rapid growth in size am prominent peripheral FLAIR hyperintense 
signal, this could represent an atypical meningioma. 
2. The lesion abuts the superior sagittal sinus without evidence 
of invasion. 
3. No additional lesions are identified. 

ECG ___:  TRACING #4
Sinus arrhythmia. Compared to tracing #3 atrial and ventricular 
premature

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG study as it 
showed the presence of continuous background disorganization 
over the left hemisphere together with continuous focal mixed 
frequency slowing in the left posterior quadrant. These findings 
are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction which is 
non-specific but may be due to a structural lesion in broadly 
distributed over the left temporal/occipital regions. There were 
no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There 
were no pushbutton activations.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's, HCV infection and history 
of autoimmune hepatitis, who presented with an unresponspive 
episode/syncope, concerning for seizure given appearance of 
large brain mass on head CT, now with MRI concerning for 
atypical meningioma.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============

# Atypical meningioma: 
Patient presented with an episode of syncope that most likely 
represented seizure given brain mass on MRI (per niece, did not 
actually occur on the toilet, episode occurred while patient 
seated at dinner table, making vasovagal syncope less likely).  
Cardiogenic causes also less likely, given her atrial 
fibrillation has been stable without any rate control agents 
(unclear if this is new).  No evidence of infection as 
predisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  
She did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI 
brain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the 
interhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an 
atypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would 
not want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg 
PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient 
neuro follow-up. 

# A. fib: 
Paroxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC 
score 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, 
decision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, 
and intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus 
vulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  
Niece in agreement with decision.

# Fever, leukocytosis: 
Patient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, 
resolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work 
up unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible 
that she aspirated during her syncopal event.

# ___: 
Cr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with 
hydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts 
and resolution with IVF.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============

# Autoimmune hepatitis  
The patient was continued on her home prednisone  

# Hypertension  
The patient was continued on her home nifedipine  

# Alzheimer's dementia
The patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout 
this hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil 
and memantine.  

# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)
# CONTACT:  ___ ___

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric 
fissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical 
meningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's 
niece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on 
Keppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up 
with her neurologist as an outpatient
- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this 
admission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for 
rate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated 
given her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of 
her atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life 
expectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on 
her home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.
- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider 
starting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol 
succinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital after having 
what was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and 
found a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may 
increase your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an 
antiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to 
take twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any 
surgery to remove or chemotherapy.

While you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal 
heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the 
risk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner 
to decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, 
so in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start 
you on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this 
decision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like 
to revisit this issue.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ PMHx advanced Alzheimer's dementia, chronic 
HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and AFib who presents from her SNF 
for RLE DVT.

Per report from her SNF, the patient had been complaining of RLE 
pain.  LENIs showed DVT after which the patient was transferred 
to ___. 

In the ED, initial VS 98.1, 84, 142/65, 16, 98% RA.  Initial 
labs were unremarkable.   CXR here showed no evidence of PNA.  
UA was grossly positive and the patient was given IV 
ceftriaxone, Lovenox 70 mg x 1 prior to transfer.

Of note, the patient was most recently discharged from ___ in 
___ for seizure activity and was found to have a 3 cm 
atypical meningioma. Per ___ discussion with the patient's 
niece, surgical intervention was deferred.  Her course at the 
time was also notable for new paroxysmal AFib; given her 
CHADSVASC score of 4, anticoagulation was warranted.  However, 
given her age, risk of fall, and her new intracranial lesion 
(high risk for venous bleed), anticoagulation was deferred.  
From further collateral information obtained from her SNF (Vero 
Health and Rehab of Mattapan) this evening, it is unclear why 
the patient was not started on anticoagulation for DVT treatment 
and why the patient was transferred to ___ for further 
evaluation.  The ED attempted to reach out to the family re: 
utility of IVC filter placement in this setting, but was unable 
to contact the family.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient denies any chest pain or 
SOB.  She has had a cough x 2 weeks; she has had no fevers.  She 
is AOx2 to self and place (at baseline).  She denies any 
dysuria, urinary incontinence or increased urinary frequency.
 
Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI

K-3.3 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-___ with PMH Alzheimer's dementia, diabetes, coming from OSH for 
altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypernatermia and 
hyperglycemia likely due to pneumonia.  She was initially 
admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.

# Hypernatremia: She appeared to have hypovolemic hypernatremia 
based on clinical exam findings of dry mucous membranes, 
significant respiratory variation in IVC diameter, and IJ 
collapse with respiratory variation.  This is likely 
multifactorial in the setting of worsening mental status related 
to infection in combination with dementia. Pt was calculated to 
have a free water deficit of ~5L. Her hypernatremia was 
gradually corrected over the course of 2.5 days with ___ NS 
after volume resuscitation with LR.  Her sodium was monitored 
daily and remained within the normal range. Would continue to 
monitor weekly while at rehab and encourage liquid intake.

# HCAP: On presentation, pt had worsening mental status, 
leukocytosis, and CXR c/w possible left lower lobe PNA.  She had 
a new O2 requirement as well.  She was started on vanc, zosyn, 
and azythromycin. She completed an 8 day course on ___.  
PICC was removed prior to discharge.  Over the course of her 
stay in the ICU, her O2 requirement resolved. At discharge she 
was afebrile, oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air 
breathing comfortably, some improving rhonchi at bases. 

# Nutrition/Goals of Care: It was suspected that her subacute 
weight loss is due to her dementia. She was seen by speach and 
swallow who provided diet recommendations. Also recent 
malnutrition due to acute illess. The issue of inadequate 
nutrition in patients with progressive dementia was discussed 
with her son ___. We dicussed adding high calorie supplements 
to her diet and asssitance with feeding. He will consider using 
an appetite stimulant with her outpatient providers. We 
discussed that there is no evidence that tube feeding will 
improve quality or longevity of life, which he recognized saying 
that he had dealt with similar issues with his father's chronic 
progressive illness and ultimately passing. 
DIET: 
Regular; Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed 
(dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids Supplement: Glucerna 
shake breakfast, lunch, dinner pills crushed in puree. 
Aspiration precautions, please provide assistance with feeding. 

# HTN: Pt was mildly hypotensive on arrival and required volume 
resuscitation; metoprolol was therefore held. These were later 
restarted.

# Depression: she was continued on her home dose of 20mg 
citalopram.

# H/o CVA: She was continued on her home simva 20 and ASA 81.

#Anemia: Patient hematocrit trended down during hospitalization 
to 25. Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. 
Hematocrit remained stable at 25. 

Code status: Full code, although son ___ is HCP and 
reconsidering and would continue to address goals of care

TRANSITIONAL: 
-monitor electrolytes (potassium, sodium)
-monitor CBC for recovery of RBC count
-add high calorie supplements to meals, assistance with feedings

Micro:  
___ urine culture negative
___ blood culture negative
___ RPR negative  
.  
Imaging:  
___ CXR: The lungs are clear bilaterally with no areas of focal 
consolidation. Previously seen pleural plaque is again noted at 
the right lung base. There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. There is prominence of the ascending aorta which 
likely represents post-stenotic dilation from aortic stenosis. 
The aorta is also mildly tortuous but unchanged. Heart size is 
normal. Multiple clips are again noted in the left upper 
quadrant. IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.  

___ EKG: Sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ there is no significant change. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with multi-infarct dementia who presents with 
lethargy and hypotension found to have acute renal failure, all 
of which was responsive to IV hydration.  
.  
# Hypotension: Patient's only localizing symptom is nausea 
without vomiting, diarrhea, fever or leukocytosis so infection 
is unlikely. A normal random cortisol ruled out adrenal 
insufficiency.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  Most 
likely etiology is poor PO intake in the setting of 
anti-hypertensives.  He was hypertensive during the remainder of 
his stay.  His isosorbide and lisinopril were initially held but 
restarted.  His atenolol was held until he sees his PCP in 
follow up.  
.  
# Poor PO intake: Patient reported nausea last night without 
abdominal pain. He is asymptomatic, and ate three full meals 
while admitted. Labs on admission revealed a mildly elevated 
lipase with normal LFT's and white count.  ACS was unlikely 
given 3 days of symptoms and troponin is <0.1.  Urine and blood 
cultures were negative.  Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia 
prior to eating. 
.  
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine elevated on 
admission to 1.8, downtrending after IVF overnight to 1.5. 
Baseline creatinine is 1.2. Likely prerenal due to poor PO 
intake over the past few days and his positive response to fluid 
challenge.  His atenolol was held accordingly.
.  
# Rash on Palms: Unclear from notes how long this has been 
present. Patient had a negative RPR in ___, and unlikely to 
have developed syphilis since then. RPR negative.  
.  
# Anemia: Hematocrit at baseline this morning.  Iron studies, 
B12 and folate were within normal limits.
.  
# CAD: Patient has known 3VD that is not able to be intervened 
on. Patient denies chest pain and cardiac enzymes negative x2.  
He was continued on plavix, aspirin, statin, isosorbide and his 
ACE.  His atenolol was held given ___.
.  
# Hypertension: He was hypertensive during admission as his 
atenolol was held in the setting of ___.  He was restarted on 
isosorbide and his ACE on the second day of admission.  He was 
advised to hold his atenolol until he saw his PCP.
.  
# Type 2 DM, on oral hypoglycemics:  His glipizide and metformin 
were held while admitted and he was covered with sliding scale 
insulin. 
.  
# Multi-infarct vs. Alzhemier's dementia:  Stable.  He was 
continued on his home dose Namenda and galantamine.  
.  
# GERD: His dose of Ranitidine was reduced given ARF during 
admission. 
.
# Depression: Mood appropriate. He was continued on citalopram.

RUQ US: 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New moderate intra and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation, 
for which MRCP is recommended for further assessment of the 
source of obstruction. 
2.  No evidence of portal vein thrombosis.   

CT TORSO:
IMPRESSION: 
1. There is new gastric wall thickening and soft tissue 
infiltration involving the entire lesser curvature of the 
stomach extending to involve the greater curvature as well.  
  
2. There is new ascites within the abdomen and a small new left 
pleural 
effusion.  
  
3. Multiple enlarging lymph nodes are seen, in the left 
supraclavicular, right paracardiac, right paraesophageal, right 
retrocrural paraaortic and celiac regions suspicious for 
metastatic disease. 
  
4. There is interval increase in the degree of intra- and 
extra-hepatic 
biliary ductal dilatation as well as dilatation of the 
pancreatic duct with side branch ectasia. While no obstructing 
mass is seen at the anastomosis, this is a concern. Stricturing 
at the anastomosis is also a possibility.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo w/gastric cancer presents with fatigue, dark urine. Found 
to have leukocytosis, biliary obstruction consistent with 
cholangitis.

Bile Obstruction/Septicemia from Acute Cholangitis: Found to 
have obstructive jaundice and biliary dilatation on US.  Patient 
was started on Zosyn and hospitalized.  ERCP was consulted and 
ERCP was attempted but aborted given findings of recurrent 
gastric CA (see below).  Thus, he was taken to ___ for PTC and 
external-internal drain placement on ___.  During his course 
initial blood cultures grew Enterobacter.  He was on Zosyn then 
transitioned to Ceftriaxone until clearance of cultures.  He was 
ultimately changed to Cipro/Flagyl per sensitivities.  With 
external drain, his bili improved as did his symptoms, even 
after capping.  He was discharged to complete a 2 week course of 
Cipro/Flagyl after PTC, and discharged with a capped drain.  The 
drain can be internalized to a metal stent pending Oncologic 
evaluation and decision of further treatment of his gastric 
cancer.

demonstrated probable recurrence of his gastric CA.  Biopsy was 
performed which confirmed a mucinous adenocarcinoma.  He 
underwent repeat CT torso showing thickened stomach wall, with 
numerous pathologic lymph nodes and an adrenal nodule, all 
suspicious for cancer spread.  This was all discussed with the 
patient and his wife.  General surgery team that was following 
recommended referral to a surgical oncologist to determine 
surgical options.  Medical oncology follow up was arranged to 
facilitate this, as well as to discuss medical oncologic 
management

proximally. 
2. Successful bilateral 8 ___ percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. 

IMPRESSION:  
Successful placement of bilateral 8 ___ nephrostomy tubes. 

CXR ___:
Increased bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis or 
aspiration/pneumonia. 
There is new mild pulmonary vascular congestion as well. No 
pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is within 
normal limits.  A right chest wall power injectable Port-A-Cath 
tip projects over the right atrium. 

CT A/P w/out Contrast ___:
1. Status post placement of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy 
tubes, which appear appropriate in position.  Improvement in the 
previously visualized bilateral hydronephrosis.  Moderate 
bilateral perinephric stranding, likely procedure related. 
2. Status post radical cystectomy with a right lower quadrant 
ileal conduit, which is unremarkable in appearance.  Small 
volume nonhemorrhagic free fluid within the pelvis, unchanged. 
3. Cholelithiasis. 
4. Degenerative changes at L5-S1 with osteolytic changes 
involving right 
aspect of the L5 vertebral body. 

Second Opinion CT Torso from ___:
Infiltrative retroperitoneal soft tissue mass at L5 level 
invading bilateral distal ureters leading to upstream moderate 
bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, with encasement of right common 
iliac artery and erosion of the L5 vertebral body.  Findings are 
consistent with disease recurrence. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with history of bladder cancer s/p cystectomy 
and ileal conduit ___ and chemotherapy who presents with 
bilateral hydronephrosis and ___ now s/p bilateral percutaneous 
nephrostomy tube placement admitted to the ICU for concerns of 
urosepsis.

# Urosepsis
# Septic Shock
The patient was initially admitted to the ICU in the setting of 
leukopenia, tachycardia, and fever to 103 after bilateral 
nephrostomy tube placement/decompression concerning for 
urosepsis and possible transient bacteremia.  She was started on 
broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime given 
recent instrumentation and altered GU anatomy.  There were no 
prior urine cultures available for sensitivities however, the 
patient had no recent history of antibiotic use.  Blood and 
urine cultures were sent and the patient was given approximately 
89 L of IVF.  On ___, she was started on vasopressors- 
norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine due to MAPs in 
the ___.  An arterial line was placed to closely monitor blood 
pressures.  Her 3 pressor shock slowly resolved with continued 
antibiotics and she was completely weaned off vasopressors on 
___.  She remained off vasopressors for more than 24 hours and 
was thought to be stable enough to transfer to the medical 
floors for further care.  After transfer to the floor, pt 
continued to improve with leukocytosis that improved from 33 to 
10 on day of discharge. Her abx were de-escalated to CTX and 
subsequently Cipro for completion of 14-day course.

# Acute kidney failure
# Bilateral hydronephrosis
An outside hospital CT read with R ureteral obstruction from 
soft tissue mass to right of L5 causing ureteral obstruction.  
Her Cr improved with placement of bilateral PCN tubes and with 
volume resuscitation, though the slow rate of renal recovery 
also suggested that there was likely a component of 
post-obstructive ATN as well.

# Hyperkalemia->hypokalemia
Her K was mildly elevated at 5.3 upon presentation likely d/t 
ARF.  This improved with relief of urinary obstruction and pt 
developed post-obstructive diuresis and associated hypokalemia.  
K was aggressively repleted and was stable at 4.1 on discharge.

# ___ Edema: Pt noted to have 2+ R>LLE edema upon transfer to the 
floor.  Etiology felt to be ___ aggressive volume resuscitation 
in the ICU, considered diuresis but pt noted to be orthostatic 
after ambulation (likely due to venous pooling in the ___ due 
to venous insufficiency).  RLE dopplers were obtained and were 
negative for DVT.  She will be given compression stockings to 
help with venous pooling.

# Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder
# R abdominal soft tissue mass
# Weight loss
The patient was followed at ___ by Dr. ___. Patient 
presented with a possible new R paravertebral mass and 20lb 
weight loss, concerning for recurrence of known transitional 
cell carcinoma versus a new malignancy.  Her outpatient 
oncologist was contacted for further management recommendations 
and plans to f/u with her post-discharge.

# Macrocytic anemia
Per patient her anemia was chronic but there was some thought of 
whether she was having GI blood loss as an outpatient.  She had 
no e/o active bleeding, most likely inflammatory cause.  She 
received 2U pRBC transfusions during this hospitalization with 
discharge Hb stable at mid 9's-10.

# Hypothyroidism
She was continued on home levothyroxine 125 mcg daily.

TRANSITIONAL:

CXR
1.  PREVIOUS MILD PULMONARY EDEMA RESOLVED. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions 

CT Urogram
1. No evidence of renal, ureteral, or bladder calculi. 
2. No evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right and 
small 
pericardial effusion, overall mildly increased from ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o vascular dementia, recent admissions ___ for fevers 
and CP felt to be from PNA and before that an admission in 
___ for TAVR c/b heart block requiring pacemaker c/b c. 
diff, presents with report of fever, elevated inflammatory 
markers, malaise/anorexia and acute on chronic low back pain. 

#Fever, generalized weakness, anorexia. One fever reported at 
home to 101.4 2 days prior to admission per husband. No 
documented fevers while here. In ED WBC 13, lactate 2.2, HDS.  
WBC normalized. UA clean, CXR clean. Had recent course of 
levaquin for pneumonia, now only with mild cough and clear 
sputum; PNA seems unlikely.  CTU (originally ordered for ? flank 
pain in ED) unrevealing except pericardial effusion; present 
since her TAVR, but appears to be possibly increasing on current 
CT. No severe or positional CP, EKG is v-paced, ECHO ___ without 
worsened effusion, but still would consider pericarditis given 
no other obvious cause for fever and systemic inflammation and 
enlarging effusion on CT (although this can be over-read).  CK 
currently low, no myositis. PMR still on the ddx given elevated 
ESR/CRP and tender proximal/girdle muscles. Adrenal insuff 
unlikely, no hypotension, weight loss, eosinophilia but could 
consider if nothing else turns up. Recent TSH normal. Anemia 
could be contributing to weakness, but is not severe. 
Patient will follow up with PCP, ___.

#Acute on chronic low back pain.  Per husband and patient she 
gets many aches and pains including low back pain similar to 
what she has now, usually responds to percocets at home.  Since 
her surgery she has had decreased energy and has been more 
sedentary, this may be contributing to her musculoskeletal low 
back pain. No evidence that this is pyelo, renal calculi, or 
neurologic.  CK low, not myositis. She is a difficult historian, 
but on exam was tender throughout the pelvic girdle, in this 
clinical setting this raises concern for PMR as above, and would 
consider rheumatology evaluation as an outpatient. 

#AS s/p TAVR c/b CHB with PPM. Continued ASA/plavix. Per Dr. 
___ will call ___ to overbook in clinic next 
___, patient will call Dr. ___ phone to touch 
base.  Repeat ECHO if Dr. ___ it is indicated.

#Anemia. Has been anemic since ___ after TAVR likely ___ 
blood loss, received 4u RBC's that admission, and additional 1u 
RBC ___ during last admission. Hgb currently 10.7 up from 8's 
suggesting appropriate response to recent transfusion, and 
likely hemoconcentrated now. Recent iron studies show replete 
iron stores and likely low available iron in setting of 
inflammation. B12 not current but has been normal in the past. 
Recent haptoglobin high. Retic index recently low, marrow likely 
suppressed in setting of inflammation. Complains of hemmorhoids 
requiring surgery, but currently no symptoms. Stable HCT while 
here.

#Hyperglycemia, no known dx of DM. A1C 5.7.  Current glucoses 
160's-170's, perhaps ___ stress response/inflammation.

#HTN. Held home hctz while here.

Chronic/inactive issues:

#HLD
-cont statin

#Depression
-cont citalopram, gabapentin

#Dementia
-cont donepezil 

Transitional Issues:
-as above given elevated inflammatory markers without source of 
infection,  anemia of inflammation, pelvic girdle pain, likely 
reactive thrombocytosis, would consider polymyalgia rheumatica 
and rheumatologic evaluation.  Doubt that pericardial effusion 
is responsible for all of her symptoms, but she will see Dr. 
___ week and get an ECHO if he feels it will be helpful. 
Would also consider adrenal insufficiency if no other cause for 
her symptoms is identified.

STUDIES:
===========
CT chest with contrast ___ ___
There are large pulmonary emboli involving the main pulmonary 
arteries extending in the bilateral upper lobes, right middle 
lobe, and bilateral lower lobes. There is mild septal deviation 
to the left. The aortia is of normal caliber. There is no 
lymphadenopathy. The major airways are patent. There are 
grounglass opacities in the left upper lobe. There is no pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental 
atelectasis, scarring. 

Impression:
Positive for pulmonary emboli with large clot burden.
Grounglass opacities in the left upper lobe, nonspecific, may be 
infectious/inflammatory or atypical pulmonary infarct.

Echo ___:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular 
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There 
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within 
normal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 


IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with abnormal 
septal motion suggestive of right ventricular pressure/volume 
overload (e.g. primary pulmonary process such as PE or COPD). 
Mildly dilated aortic root. Severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension.

Lower extremity Doppler US:
Left deep venous thrombus within the proximal femoral vein 
extending to 
the popliteal vein, nonocclusive. Posterior tibial occlusive 
thrombus 
identified. Right popliteal deep venous non occlusive thrombus. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is ___ year old male who presented with one day 
history of SOB found to have bilateral PE's at outside hospital, 
troponin of 0.32, sinus tachycardia on ECG, and right 
ventricular strain on Echo requiring transfer to CCU for 
thrombolysis.

#Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms: 
Patient noted to have bilateral pulmonary embolism noted at 
outside hospital to have bilateral pulmonary embolism. The 
patient was transferred to the CCU for thrombolysis. The patient 
was started on tPA protocol as follows: tPA 10mg IV over 1 
minute then 40mg over 2 hours with continued Unfractionated 
heparin at 1000u/hour with transition to weight based heparin 
until therapeutic. Following this, the patient was started on 
xarelto 15 mg BID on ___ for 3 weeks and then continued on 
20 mg xarelto daily. Ambulating on 5L O2, he gets moderately SOB 
but mainatins O2 sat > 88%. He has been instructed to use O2 
with any exertion. The etiology of the patient's pulmonary 
embolism and lower extremity DVT's was unclear but thought to be 
due to possible factor V leiden deficiency and other work up 
given family history in mother of recurrent DVT's as well as 
recurrent DVT's in father. Plan for outpatient follow up with 
Hem/Onc to address hypercoagulable work up with Factor V Leiden 
and antiphospholipid syndrome. Patient also with plan to follow 
up with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. 

#Hypoxia
Patient's hypoxia and oxygen requirement thought to be secondary 
to bilateral pulmonary embolisms as above. The patient was 
discharged with home oxygen requirement for sleep and 
ambulation.

#Type II Diabetes with peripheral neuropathy
Patient continued on ISS and daily lantus and humalog. Metformin 
held.
Gabapentin 100 mg TID continued

#HLD
Patient continued on simvastatin 40 mg daily.

#Chronic Low Back Pain
Patient with chronic low back pain. He was continued on tramadol 
50 mg daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: ___ with relapsed AML, 24 months after allo transplant 
s/p reinduction therapy with MEC + Lenalidomide, here for 
planned admission for second allo transplant with a different, 
matched unrelated donor. Bone marrow engrafted well and patient 
cell counts had fully restored by post-transplant day 14. 
Hospital course was predominantly complicated by intermittent 
altered mental status and neutropenic fever, as described below: 


ACUTE ISSUES:

# Relapsed AML s/p MUD allo-SCT (___)
# Macrocytic anemia, stable
Patient underwent reinduction with MEC + Lenalidomide (protocol 
___ phase 2 study) for treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory AML and was admitted for planned allo SCT 
from an unrelated donor. She received RIC conditioning with 
Flu/Mel beginning ___ and Methotrexate administration on post 
transplant Days 1, 6, and ___. Patient was maintained on 
posaconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone prophylaxis with plans 
to initiate Bactrim prophylaxis on ___. Patient tacrolimus 
levels were checked weekly and adjusted throughout his 
hospitalization course (most recent level of 10.6 on ___, 
regimen changed from 0.5 mg BID to 0.5/0.25 alternating 
regimen). EBV viral loads measured bi-weekly (negative to date) 
and CMV viral load were measured weekly and negative throughout 
patient hospital course. Patient spiked intermittent low grade 
fevers throughout the first two weeks of his post transplant 
course without localizing symptoms and negative infectious work 
up. He was managed on Vancomycin and Cefepime from ___ to ___ 
and remained afebrile after both medications were discontinued. 
Patient pain was initially managed with oxycodone and Ativan, 
however, was transitioned to Tylenol/tramadol regimen in setting 
of alterations of mental status (described below)

#AMS: Patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of 
altered mental status approximately 1 week after transplant. He 
initially described episodes as ""hallucinations"" in which he 
imagined conversations and encounters that did not occur, as 
well as experiencing intermittent auditory hallucinations in 
which he would hear music that was not playing. Episodes were 
initially associated with headaches and patient underwent brain 
MRI that was negative for PRES syndrome, however, showed 
symmetric linear dural enhancement. Neuro-oncology and neurology 
felt that imaging finding was likely was secondary to medication 
toxicity (cefepime) and did not explain his clinical 
presentation. He subsequently underwent diagnostic LP that 
showed elevated protein (>90) as well as 28 TNC with lymphocytic 
predominance. Flow cytometry was not consistent with CNS 
involvement in AML and work-up for viral etiology was negative 
(with several tests pending). Ultimately, transient nature of 
waning mental status was felt to be inconsistent with infectious 
etiology and symptoms were ultimately felt to be largely 
secondary to multiple mind-altering medications 
(oxycodone/Ativan/ambien). Patient mental status largely 
improved with discontinuation of this regimen and PRN Haldol and 
ramelteon regimen. Patient went several days with appropriate 
mental status and without hallucinations prior to discharge.

# Weight loss
# Decreased appetite
24 pound weight loss in the setting of re-induction; however 
slowly regained weight post transplant. Admission weight is 
89.4kg (197 lbs). Daily weights were measured and nutrition 
consulted. Home vitamin D supplement continued along with a 
multivitamin starting day 1. Weight on discharge is 176.8 lb

CHRONIC ISSUES:
---------------
# Adjustment disorder
# Anxiety
Home citalopram was continued throughout hospital course. 
Patient was initially prescribed Ativan for anxiety, however, 
medication was discontinued I/s/o AMS. Patient was prescribed 
ramelteon for sleep, however, ultimately was to help with sleep, 
however, ultimately was able to sleep through the night without 
medication. Social work followed with the patient throughout the 
hospitalization.

# Sinus bradycardia: 
HR 58 on admission, presumably physiologic secondary to his 
young age and the fact that he is physically fit. 

# Mild mitral regurgitation
# Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation
# Mild pulmonary artery hypertension
Noted on echocardiogram, no cardiac or respiratory symptoms. 
Euvolemic on exam. Was closely monitored for symptoms or signs 
of volume overload, especially in the setting of transfusions, 
however was not an active issue during his hospital course.
