In the ED it was determined that \nyou had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by \nyour recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional \nradiology performed a thrombin injection into your \npseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable \npain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. \nThis pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. \nWe treated your pain with IV pain medication and \nanti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned \nyou to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your \npain.\n\nYou had constipation during your admission though you do have \nbaseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you \non a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and \nbiscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during \nyour hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you \nhave constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain \ncontrol, have not physically been moving since your procedure \nand have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with \nsenna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement \nin the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which \nyou noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary \ncare physician.\n\nYou were started on the following new medications:\n**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication \nreduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take \nthis medication with food and water since it can cause stomach \nirritation.\n**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for \npain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause \nconstipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not \ndrive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.\n**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation\n**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation\n**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipation\n\nFollow up as per below.\n\nIf you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, \nincreased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness \nof breath please call your primary care provider or go to the \nemergency department for evaluation.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

The left atrium is normal in size. \nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \nmotion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The \nnumber of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic \nvalve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic \nvalve stenosis (valve area = 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be \nunderestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is \nseen (may be underestimated). There is borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least \nmoderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated \npulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to \na very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial \neffusion.  \n\n___ CT CHEST \n \nAlthough there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, severe \ncoronary \ncalcification and sufficient aortic valvular calcification to \nproduce aortic stenosis, the extremely asymmetric and non \ndependent distribution of the severe interstitial and alveolar \nabnormality, favoring the right lung and \nscattered elsewhere in the periphery of the left lung means that \ncardiogenic pulmonary edema is not a sufficient explanation for \nthe severe lung findings although it may be contributory. \n  \nDifferential diagnosis of the pulmonary abnormality includes \nsevere viral \ninfection, viral infection leading to diffuse alveolar damage, \nand acute \ninterstitial pneumonia.  The large region of sparing in the left \nlower lobe argues against pneumocystis pneumonia, but certainly \ndoes not exclude that \ndiagnosis. \nSevere generalized atherosclerotic calcification involves the \nhead and neck vessels, particular the carotid arteries in \naddition to the coronaries. \n\n___ CT CHEST:  \n1.  Slight interval improvement in persistent extensive \npulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, worst in the right upper \nlobe.  Differential diagnosis includes, as before, severe viral \ninfection and acute interstitial pneumonia.  \nChronic aspiration is possible as well. \n2.  Posterior defect in the trachea is not currently seen and \nlikely \nrepresented artifact on prior CT.  Confirmation of \ntracheoesophageal fistula would require barium swallow study \nunder fluoroscopy. \n  \nMICRO:\n\n___ 6:26 pm Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture\n      Site: NASOPHARYNX      Source: Nasopharyngeal swab. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Respiratory Viral Culture (Final ___: \n      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED. \n      Refer to respiratory viral antigen screen and respiratory \nvirus\n      identification test results for further information. \n\n   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final ___: \n      Positive for Respiratory viral antigens. \n      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, \nInfluenza A, B,\n      and RSV by immunofluorescence. \n      Refer to Respiratory Virus Identification for further \ninformation. \n\n   Respiratory Virus Identification (Final ___: \n      Reported to and read back by ___ (4I) ___ AT \n1139. \n      POSITIVE FOR PARAINFLUENZA TYPE 3. \n         Viral antigen identified by immunofluorescence. \n\n                      **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final ___: \n      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN. \n           (Reference Range-Negative). \n      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay. \n      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other \nL.\n      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. \nFurthermore, in\n      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may \nvary. \n\n___ 4:27 am SPUTUM\n\n   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: \n      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field. \n      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. \n\n   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary): \n\n___ 12:23 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab. \n\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\n\n   MRSA SCREEN (Final ___:    No MRSA isolated. \n\n___ URINE CULTURE - NEG\n___ BLOOD CULTURE - NEG\n\nDISCHARGE LABS:\n\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD WBC-12.3* RBC-2.28* Hgb-7.3* Hct-22.0* \nMCV-97 MCH-32.0 MCHC-33.2 RDW-20.3* RDWSD-70.2* Plt ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD Plt ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD ___ PTT-35.2 ___\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD Glucose-101* UreaN-16 Creat-1.0 Na-126* \nK-4.1 Cl-86* HCO3-30 AnGap-14\n___ 01:56AM BLOOD ALT-29 AST-31 LD(LDH)-577* AlkPhos-127 \nTotBili-0.___ y/o male with a PMH of rheumatoid arthritis currently \nreceiving rituximab (q6 months), plaquenil, and prednisone \n(history of multiple previous DMARDs), recent diagnosis of \nEnterococcal bacteremia and osteomyelitis at an OSH, MDS, afib, \nand CHF currently admitted to ___ with dyspnea and hypoxia \nfound to have substantial bilateral interstitial and alveolar \ndisease on CT imaging.

Compared to the previous \ntracing of ___ there is no significant change. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old male with multi-infarct dementia who presents with \nlethargy and hypotension found to have acute renal failure, all \nof which was responsive to IV hydration.  \n.  \n# Hypotension: Patient's only localizing symptom is nausea \nwithout vomiting, diarrhea, fever or leukocytosis so infection \nis unlikely. A normal random cortisol ruled out adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  Most \nlikely etiology is poor PO intake in the setting of \nanti-hypertensives.  He was hypertensive during the remainder of \nhis stay.  His isosorbide and lisinopril were initially held but \nrestarted.  His atenolol was held until he sees his PCP in \nfollow up.  \n.  \n# Poor PO intake: Patient reported nausea last night without \nabdominal pain. He is asymptomatic, and ate three full meals \nwhile admitted. Labs on admission revealed a mildly elevated \nlipase with normal LFT's and white count.  ACS was unlikely \ngiven 3 days of symptoms and troponin is <0.1.  Urine and blood \ncultures were negative.  Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia \nprior to eating. \n.  \n# Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine elevated on \nadmission to 1.8, downtrending after IVF overnight to 1.5. \nBaseline creatinine is 1.2. Likely prerenal due to poor PO \nintake over the past few days and his positive response to fluid \nchallenge.  His atenolol was held accordingly.\n.  \n# Rash on Palms: Unclear from notes how long this has been \npresent. Patient had a negative RPR in ___, and unlikely to \nhave developed syphilis since then. RPR negative.  \n.  \n# Anemia: Hematocrit at baseline this morning.  Iron studies, \nB12 and folate were within normal limits.\n.  \n# CAD: Patient has known 3VD that is not able to be intervened \non. Patient denies chest pain and cardiac enzymes negative x2.  \nHe was continued on plavix, aspirin, statin, isosorbide and his \nACE.  His atenolol was held given ___.\n.  \n# Hypertension: He was hypertensive during admission as his \natenolol was held in the setting of ___.  He was restarted on \nisosorbide and his ACE on the second day of admission.  He was \nadvised to hold his atenolol until he saw his PCP.\n.  \n# Type 2 DM, on oral hypoglycemics:  His glipizide and metformin \nwere held while admitted and he was covered with sliding scale \ninsulin. \n.  \n# Multi-infarct vs. Alzhemier's dementia:  Stable.  He was \ncontinued on his home dose Namenda and galantamine.  \n.  \n# GERD: His dose of Ranitidine was reduced given ARF during \nadmission. \n.\n# Depression: Mood appropriate.
